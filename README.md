For object oriented python tomorrow, we will first review our Monday lesson. 

Then we will examine the use of classes in the following source code:
* https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html
* https://github.com/python-engineer/youtube-analyzer/blob/master/yt_stats.py


Finally, we will use object-oriented programming to make a representation of a deck of cards in Python. (edited)
